The uncmap plugin maps windows drive letter file names to UNC links.

===== Download and Installation =====

Download and install the plugin using the [[doku>plugin:plugin|Plugin Manager]] using the following URL:

   * Unstable **development version** from the [[http://github.com/cosmocode/uncmap|git repository]] ([[http://github.com/cosmocode/uncmap/tarball/master|tgz]])

Refer to [[doku>Plugins]] on how to install plugins manually.

===== Usage =====

Just use the normal link syntax with drive letters.

===== Configuration =====

The plugin adds an optional option to the [[doku>config|config manager]] where you can configure a mount point for the fileserver. This directory is used to check whether a linked file exists.

Moreover, the file ''conf/mapping.php'' in the plugin directory is used to specify drive to mount mappings.
