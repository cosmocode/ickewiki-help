{{ quicksubscribe.png?direct|}}
The quicksubscribe plugin provides a simpler interface to [[doku>subscription|page subscriptions]]. 

===== Download and Installation =====

Download and install the plugin using the [[doku>plugin:plugin|Plugin Manager]] using the following URL:

   * Unstable **development version** from the [[http://github.com/cosmocode/quicksubscribe|git repository]] ([[http://github.com/cosmocode/quicksubscribe/tarball/master|tgz]])

Refer to [[doku>Plugins]] on how to install plugins manually.

The quicksubscribe plugin needs the [[ajaxloader|ajaxloader plugin]].

After installation you need to put the subscribe icon into your template's main.php:

<code php>
<?php
    $quicksubscribe = plugin_load('helper', 'quicksubscribe');
    $quicksubscribe->tpl_subscribe();
?>
</code>

===== Usage =====

The icon shows your current subscription status: If the icon is grey, you are not subscribed, otherwise you are. By clicking on the icon, you open a popup which either subscribes you to the current namespace or shows the current subscription and allows to delete it. Moreover, a link to the subscription manage page is given.
