====== Signature Plugin ======
The cryptsign plugin allows users to sign parts of a wiki page.

===== Download and Installation =====

Download and install the plugin using the [[doku>plugin:plugin|Plugin Manager]] using the following URL:

   * Unstable **development version** from the [[http://github.com/cosmocode/cryptsign|git repository]] ([[http://github.com/cosmocode/cryptsign/tarball/master|tgz]])

Refer to [[doku>Plugins]] on how to install plugins manually.

===== Usage =====

Use the new toolbar button to sign a wiki text. The text will then get a green background and a closed lock as long as it is unchanged, and red background and broken lock if it is changed. This does not protect against text removals or adding new, unsigned text â€“ it just assures that a specific text has been written by a specific user on a specific page ID in a specific Wiki.
