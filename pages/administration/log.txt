====== Log Plugin ======
{{ log.png?367&direct|A log with two entries, the form for creating new entries and a link to the complete log}}
The log plugin implements a simple log facility for individual files. Log entries are stored in a separate log page. A small, configurable number of newest log entries is shown together with a form for creating new entries and a link to the complete log. 

===== Download and Installation =====

Download and install the plugin using the [[doku>plugin:plugin|Plugin Manager]] using the following URL:

   * Unstable **development version** from the [[http://github.com/cosmocode/log|git repository]] ([[http://github.com/cosmocode/log/tarball/master|tgz]])

Refer to [[doku>Plugins]] on how to install plugins manually.

===== Usage =====

To attach a log to a page, just write ''%%{{log}}%%'' at the location you want the log to appear. A form will be inserted there, and after writing the first log entry, a log page will be created. Optionally, you might specify how much entries from the log should be displayed (at maximum): ''%%{{log>10}}%%''. The default is 5.

===== Configuration =====

The plugin adds options to the [[doku>config|config manager]] where you can:

  * Specify the ID of a log page, more specifically: The part that is attached to the page ID to get its log page ID
  * A printf string specifying how to construct a link to a user page for a given user; only useful if you have pages for your users
